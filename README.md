#  Mastodon Glitch Edition  #

This is my slightly modified version of Mastodon Glitch Edition running [mstdn.thms.uk](https://mstdn.thms.uk).

The changes currently implemented are:

 - [Lenghty posts aren't collapsed by default](https://github.com/nanos/mastodon/commit/44c51681492efc863351317309ce7115f914b54e)
 - [Larger and imo prettier link previews](https://github.com/nanos/mastodon/commit/b954cd1d0e613d6c3d8b2d3bef1909c1df968323), [now with CSS included](https://github.com/nanos/mastodon/commit/bdadb57a73b50d6a0777928cefc30868880ee680).

Otherwise it's standard `glitch-soc` and their documentation applies:

- You can view documentation for this project at [glitch-soc.github.io/docs/](https://glitch-soc.github.io/docs/).
- And contributing guidelines are available [here](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [here](https://glitch-soc.github.io/docs/contributing/).
